                client having 100% utilisation within a set time period. The implementation process was complex so I
                completed regular duties including: planning the process, training clients to use the product, providing
                update calls, creating reports, providing data analysis on key metrics, presenting this data to clients,
                managing expectations, conflict resolution, upselling ad-ons, generating referrals, internal set ups,
                fixing technical issues etc. <br />

                Key Locums was an established primary care locum agency. I joined as
                their sole consultant in London focusing on clients across the south of England.<br /> <br />
                I was accountable for the entire business plan. When I joined the company there were no other employees
                with experience of supply into the primary care market. the directors and senior management therefore
                decided I would be given relative freedom to grow the desk how I saw fit. Because of this, I was
                responsible for a range of daily actions including process management, planning, resourcing, business
                development, compliance checks, timesheet procedure, etc. I created numerous processes around each task
                to try and drive efficiency and provide maximum revenue generation.<br /> <br />
                During my time with the company, I worked with 2 trainee consultants who I trained and line managed
                alongside my other duties. I used various KPIs and regular 1-1s to ensure that they were both happy and
                effective in their roles. <br /> <hr />

            <div class="col-md-8">
                The GP agency began trading in September 2016. As a start up environment I worked with
                maximum of 7 total employees at any one time during my employment. My remit was to actively provide
                workers to primary care services across England and build relevant processes in the business to allow
                the company to scale effectively. <br>
                At times throughout my employment I was involved in all aspects of the business including: <br /> <br />
                <ul>
                    <li>Creating and actively completing a daily/weekly sourcing process in order to grow the database.
                    </li>
                    <li>Supervising admin/compliance team and updating their day to day processes.</li>
                    <li>Completing business development duties including cold calls, emails and meetings to secure new
                        business.</li>
                    <li>Negotiating terms, rates and signing of contracts/agreements with new and existing
                        clients/candidates.</li>
                    <li>Servicing clients by providing regular locum staff to cover their requirements.</li>
                    <li>Providing data reports, analysis and business plans for the managing/financial directors.</li>
                </ul>
                I was also heavily involved with the setup of our compliance structures. I outlined the processes
                and then actively managed and monitored the 3 part-time admin staff who were responsible for compliance. <br /><hr />

                My role was to supply staff to the private sector, covering all nursing specialities. My clients were
                wide ranging which meant I required an understanding of how to cater my approach to different needs. Furthermore, 
                I was involved with bringing on new business from the first
                point of contact. This included sending and confirming terms of business, negotiating rates, and
                providing staff to ensure the clientâ€™s needs were fully met. a large part of my role was sourcing suitable 
                candidates. I spent lots of time qualifying candidates for roles within the private sector.
                <br /> <br />
                Initially I was a trainee consultant until July 2016. During this time, I worked on the midwifery
                bookings team which covered both NHS and Private healthcare clients. I built relationships with them
                through regular visits, emails and telephone calls to both staff banks and hospital wards. I was also
                involved in the resourcing of new candidates.
